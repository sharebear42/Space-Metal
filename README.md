This is a 2D physics game I made in Unity from the Space Shooter tutorial assets (plus a few others) while learning to code. 

The goal is to cross the alien infested asteroid field with enough fuel remaining to slow your ship to less than
100 m/s on the other side.

The player ships are controlled through force impulses applied to various points on the gameobjects. The enemy ship's
position is controlled through the physics engine, however, the rotation is controlled by affecting the transform. 
All damage to ships is physics based, and the battleship takes extra damage if struck in the rear section.
