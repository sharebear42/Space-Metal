# turbulent-octo-rutabaga

This is a game I made in Unity from the Space Shooter tutorial assets (plus a few others) while learning to code. 

The player ships are controlled through force impulses applied t various points on the gameobject. The enemy ship's
position is controlled through the physics engine, however, the rotation is controlled by affecting the transform. 
All damage to ships is physics based.


Assets not from the Space Shooter tutorial:
The battleship model was made by yulifernandez

The fighter model was made by homerender of Vertex Studio

The enemy2 model was made by PM_assets
